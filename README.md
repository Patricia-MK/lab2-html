Chaabilo Lubobya and Patricia Mboma Kashweka
In this lab, we created a well-structured HTML5 web page with a navigation menu, main content area, sidebar, and footer. 
We also added a contact form with HTML5 validation and ensured our code was error-free using the W3C Validator. 
Finally, we published our project on GitHub and collaborated with a group partner by forking their repository and submitting a pull request.
